          My name is Tyler Anderson and have always had an interest in all
          things computer related. I attempted to study computer science once I
          was in college, but got distracted by another subject, and graduated
          with a BS in Anthropology. I then attended a technical university and
          received an associates in Electrical Engineering. Again I was given
          the chance to code and really enjoyed it. It wasn't until many years
          and a couple jobs later that I again was given an oppourtunity to
          code. I jumped into it head on with the DU Cooding Bootcamp, and
          haven't looked back! Check out my stuff and let me know what you
          think!
